## Dublin Quiet Room DAO

# Problem

-	Lack of quiet and comfortable places to study in Dublin.
-	Public libraries are often overcrowded.
-	Shared flats offer no privacy or silence.
- This negatively affects students’ concentration, academic performance, and mental health.


“Students in Dublin struggle to find quiet and suitable places to study due to crowded public spaces and shared living environments.
This creates a need for an accessible and user-friendly solution that provides easy access to quiet study spaces.”

and accessible study spaces in Dublin through a decentralized, community-driven platform.
